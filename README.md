# JavaScript Clock App

## Welcome

This is a simple JavaScript app to show a fun clock. I am using the project to develop my skills in JavaScript as well as using SASS for the first time.

## Process

1. Setup basic HTML structure and various images/css/sass/js files.
2. Work out how to access time in JavaScript
